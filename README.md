# Project-2

Repo for project 2 in FYS-STK4155 - Classification on the Credit Card Dataset.

I have tried out two models:

- Logistic Regression using Fisher Scoring
- Neural Network using backpropagation

Both of the models have been implemented from scratch in Julia.

`Data` contains the data files that have been split into train, test, and split, as well as the means and standard deviations of the covariates. `Credit Card Data.ipynb` details the splitting and cleaning of the data. 

- `LogisticRegression`: Julia module for implementing logistic regression models
- `NeuralNetworks`: Julia module for implementing feed forward neural network models

The report is the file `Project-2-Report.pdf`
